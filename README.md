This project began as a way for me to teach myself C++, but it has since evolved to include new languages of personal interest.
The puzzles which are being solved are viewable at http://adventofcode.com/2016/

I plan on solving each problem first in C++ and later doing implementations in other languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust.
